# COVID-19 Clinical Trials EDA with Pandas

## Overview

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 clinical trials using Python's Pandas library. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the various clinical trials conducted globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle's COVID-19 Clinical Trials dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/covid19-clinical-trials-dataset). It includes information on clinical trials related to COVID-19, such as study titles, statuses, locations, and other relevant details.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, standardized data formats, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed comprehensive analysis to understand the distribution and trends within the data, including:

  - **Study Status Distribution**: Analyzed the proportion of studies based on their current status (e.g., Completed, Recruiting, Terminated).

  - **Geographical Analysis**: Examined the distribution of clinical trials across different countries and regions.

  - **Study Phases Analysis**: Investigated the distribution of trials across various phases (e.g., Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3).

  - **Sponsor Analysis**: Identified the top sponsors involved in COVID-19 clinical trials.

- **Visualization**: Utilized libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations that depict the findings of the analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Utilized for data analysis and visualization, with a focus on the Pandas library.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Employed as the interactive environment for conducting and documenting the analysis.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Used for creating visual representations of the data.

## Getting Started

To explore the analysis:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KANNAN753/COVID-19-Clinical-Trials-EDA-Pandas.git
2.**Navigate to the project directory**:
    cd COVID-19-Clinical-Trials-EDA-Pandas

3.**Install the required Python packages**:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4.**Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
    jupyter notebook Project4-COVID19\ clinical\ trials.ipynb
##Results##

The analysis provided insights into the landscape of COVID-19 clinical trials, highlighting trends in study statuses, geographical distribution, phases, and key sponsors involved.
